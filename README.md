**Tashkent** is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, situated in the northeastern part of the country. It's not only the political and economic center but also a cultural hub with a rich history.The city showcases a blend of modern and traditional architecture. While modern buildings and infrastructure have emerged, historical sites highlight the city's cultural legacy.Housing prices in the city  depends on not only infrastructure and area but  also the easier access to the public transportation , markets and especially educational institutions, such as universities , colleges and schools.

The data shows the significant price changes depended on the law about the permenant residency and the spread of the COVID 19. Overall if the apartment is low the prices are going to be higher. The higher the floor of the house, the lower its price.In Tashkent 4-5 floor apartments are very common and it affected to the price too.

In this [model](https://github.com/Mukhriddin19980901/Tashkent_housing_price_prediction/blob/main/toshkent_uylar_narxi_predictions.ipynb) I have used the Linear Regression to predict the prices.
